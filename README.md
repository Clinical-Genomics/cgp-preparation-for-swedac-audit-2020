Every 16 month Clinical Genomics is audited by Swedac and every 4th year a renewed assessment of the accreditation is performed. Next audit will be arranged on 2020-06-10. 

In order for the Swedac assessors to prepare for the visit, a number of documents must be sent to Swedac in advance. Depending on the validations and other changes performed since the last audit, additional documentation might be requested.

At audit there will be discussions and random sampling for Management and personnel as well as bioinformatic and IT related validations and verifications. A practical moment (bevittning) is also performed and a sample is followed through the analyses. Deviations from last audit will be followed up.
